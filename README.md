# Post installation deployment script

This script is created by me for personal purposes and is provided **"as is"**. The goal is to reduce the time of commissioning of the computer after reinstalling the system.

The script performs the installation of the necessary software, and in some cases even the basic setting.

For ease usage, editing and reading the script is divided into sections and annotated.
